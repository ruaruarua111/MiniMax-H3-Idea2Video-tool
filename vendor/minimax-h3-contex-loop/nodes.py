"""Pin previous-clip motion at the head of an H3 clip.

Wire it between a stock H3 conditioning node and the sampler:

    MiniMaxH3ImageToVideo / MiniMaxH3ReferenceToVideo (or the t2v path)
        -> H3 Motion Context
        -> guider / sampler

Two axes to test, both cheap.

encode_mode
  frames  one VAE call per frame, each pinned as its own cond block. The
          model sees N snapshots at N instants.
  video   one VAE call for the whole run. The H3 video VAE has latent_dim
          3, so it reads the batch axis as time and compresses the run
          into fewer latent steps (5 pixel frames -> 2 steps, 22 -> 7).
          Each step becomes one cond block, so the motion between frames
          lives inside the latent instead of being implied across separate
          stills. Far fewer rows and one VAE load.

anchor_mode
  head    pinned frames occupy indices 0..N-1 of the delivered timeline.
          They come back in the output, so trim that many frames off the
          front before concatenating.
  before  pinned frames sit at negative indices, ending at -1, so
          delivered frame 0 continues from them and nothing is wasted.
          Their time coordinates land below text_len, which is the range
          the text rows occupy. Whether that collision matters is exactly
          what this mode is asking.

    """Drop the pinned head off a decoded clip, picture and sound together.

    The pinned frames occupy the start of the delivered timeline, so they
    have to come off before concatenating. Trimming only the images would
    leave the audio a full trim_frames longer than the video, and muxing
    those puts the whole soundtrack ahead of the picture by trim_frames/24
    seconds. At 5 frames that is 208ms, silent on ambience but squarely
    offbeat on anything with a pulse.

    So this takes both streams and removes the same span from each: whole
    frames from the images, the matching number of samples from the
    waveform. Wire trim_frames from the motion context node so the count
    follows whatever the encoder actually produced.

    The tail needs the same treatment for a different reason. H3's audio
    latent runs at 40 Hz against 24 fps picture, and FRAME_RESCALE is 5/3.
    ComfyUI rounds the required audio steps to the nearest integer, so some
    valid H3 lengths decode about 8.3 ms long (124 frames) and others about
    8.3 ms short (260 frames). Either error accumulates down a chain. Match
    Tail truncates excess samples or zero-pads a short decode so every
    delivered stream is exactly frames/fps long.
